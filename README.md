# Shiny---Travelling-Salesman
Final task of the "Developing Data Products" course at coursera.org.
This is an application that provides a very simple interface for solving the Traveling Salesman problem.
It allows the user to input places to travel via a leaflet map and then uses the TSP package to calculate the best route.
